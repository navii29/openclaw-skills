## Common Objections & Responses

**"We already check competitors manually"**
> "How often? Weekly? Monthly? This checks daily, automatically. And it never forgets."

**"That's expensive"**
> "What's the cost of one price war you don't see coming? One lost client to a competitor's new feature?"

**"We don't have time to monitor"**
> "That's the point - you don't have to. It runs automatically and only alerts you when something matters."

**"We already use [other tool]"**
> "Does it integrate with your existing workflow? Send Telegram alerts? Provide AI insights? This is built for OpenClaw."
