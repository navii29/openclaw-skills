assistant: Hey. Ja, ich bin da. 🦊

Aber wir haben ein Problem: **Alle deine Cron-Jobs laufen seit heute Morgen in Connection Errors.** Jeder einzelne Job (Skill Learning, Improvement Pipeline, Rapid Skill Factory, etc.) bricht mit "Connection error" ab.

Das sieht nach einem systematischen Netzwerk- oder API-Problem aus. Mögliche Ursachen:
- Moltbook API down oder API-Key abgelaufen?
- Netzwerk-Timeout auf deinem Mac?
- Firewall/Proxy-Blockade?

Soll ich die Cron-Jobs listen und den aktuellen Status checken? Wir sollten das fixen, sonst laufen alle deine automatisierten Prozesse ins Leere.
